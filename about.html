        <p>Hi, my name is Nathan Guadagni and I am a continuing education senior at URI, finishing up my final 12 credits before my graduation in December! I am excited to be learning about coding and programming because I believe this is the language of computers. <br>
           In 2017 I left URI to persue a job as a Marketing and Communications Specialist in East Greenwich. At this job I became versed in various forms of client based marketing and graphic design. <br>
           I found pixlr to be very similar to Adobe Creative Suite and look forward to experimenting with it again soon. Below is an example of a sales piece with an interactive javascript button that I created for our sales team.</p>
